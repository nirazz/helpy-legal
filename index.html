    <h1>Helpy - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Helpy ("we", "our", or "the app") is a community help matching app that connects neighbors who need help with neighbors who can help. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong> - Your display name shown to other users</li>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong> - Used for authentication and account recovery</li>
        <li><strong>Profile photo</strong> - From your Google or Apple account if you sign in with those services</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Location Data</h3>
    <p>We collect your approximate location (latitude and longitude) to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Show you help requests from nearby neighbors</li>
        <li>Calculate distances to help requests</li>
        <li>Help other users know approximately how far you are</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Location is collected only when you use the app and with your explicit permission. You can revoke location access at any time in your device settings.</p>

        <li>Chat messages between matched users</li>
        <li>Ratings and reviews of other users</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Authentication Data</h3>
    <p>We support sign-in via Email/Password, Google, and Apple. When using third-party sign-in, we receive only your name, email, and profile photo. We do not access your contacts, calendar, or other personal data from these services.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide the core service: matching helpers with those who need help</li>
        <li>To send push notifications about new offers, messages, and updates</li>
        <li>To display your profile to other users in your area</li>
        <li>To calculate and show distances between users</li>
        <li>To maintain trust through ratings and verification badges</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using Supabase, a trusted cloud database provider. All data is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. We use Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access data they are authorized to see.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

        <li>Other app users (your name, profile photo, ratings, and approximate location)</li>
        <li>Matched users (chat messages)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>We send push notifications to inform you about new help offers, accepted offers, messages, and ratings. You can disable notifications at any time in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong> your personal data</li>
        <li><strong>Delete</strong> your account and associated data</li>
        <li><strong>Opt out</strong> of push notifications</li>
