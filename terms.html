    <h1>Helpy - Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By creating an account or using Helpy ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Helpy is a community platform that connects neighbors who need help with neighbors who can help. Users can post help requests, browse nearby requests, offer assistance, and communicate through in-app messaging.</p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You must provide accurate information when creating your account.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account.</li>
        <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App.</li>
        <li>You may delete your account at any time through the Profile settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Post objectionable, offensive, or inappropriate content</li>
        <li>Harass, bully, or threaten other users</li>
        <li>Use the App for any illegal purpose</li>
        <li>Post spam, scam, or misleading content</li>
        <li>Impersonate another person</li>
        <li>Attempt to circumvent any content moderation measures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Content Policy — Zero Tolerance</h2>
    <p><strong>Helpy has a zero-tolerance policy for objectionable content and abusive behavior.</strong> This includes but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hate speech, discrimination, or content promoting violence</li>
        <li>Sexually explicit or suggestive content</li>
        <li>Content promoting illegal activities</li>
        <li>Harassment, bullying, or threats</li>
        <li>Scams, fraud, or deceptive practices</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any user found violating this policy will have their account <strong>terminated immediately</strong> and may be reported to relevant authorities.</p>

    <h2>6. Reporting and Blocking</h2>
    <p>Users can report objectionable content or abusive users through the in-app reporting feature. Users can also block other users to prevent future interactions. All reports are reviewed and appropriate action is taken, including account termination for violations.</p>

    <h2>7. Content Moderation</h2>
    <p>We employ content filtering and user reporting mechanisms to maintain a safe community. We reserve the right to remove any content and terminate any account that violates these Terms, at our sole discretion and without prior notice.</p>

    <h2>8. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of content you post. By posting content, you grant Helpy a non-exclusive license to display it within the App for the purpose of providing the service. You are solely responsible for the content you post.</p>

    <h2>9. Safety and Liability</h2>
    <p>Helpy facilitates connections between neighbors but does not guarantee the quality, safety, or outcome of any help session. Users interact at their own risk. We recommend meeting in public places and exercising common sense when meeting new people.</p>

    <h2>10. Account Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms of Service at any time and without notice. Users may also delete their own account at any time through the app settings.</p>

    <h2>11. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our <a href="https://nirazz.github.io/helpy-legal/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@help-y.com">support@help-y.com</a>.</p>
